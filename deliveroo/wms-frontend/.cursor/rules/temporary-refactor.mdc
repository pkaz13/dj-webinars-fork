# Temporary Refactors

1. No hardcoded data can remain in components. Hardcoded data is required for now, but they should be put into separate files. For instance, mock notifications should be put inside the src/app/mock/notifications.mock.ts file, and it includes MOCK_NOTIFICATIONS exported const variable. Adjust other mocks accordingly. Make sure that all imports are correct and the app compiles.

2. [interfaces.ts](mdc:src/app/types/interfaces.ts) file should be split into smaller model files in their appropriate locations. For instance, if interfaces.ts file includes a section starting with comments such as this one `// User Authentication` the the proper directory is `auth` - and there should be a new file created auth/auth.model.ts which would include these interfaces. Make sure that all imports are correct and the app compiles. So the contents of [interfaces.ts](mdc:src/app/types/interfaces.ts) should be split across domain model-relevant files/directories.
