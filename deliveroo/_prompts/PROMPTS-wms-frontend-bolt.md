## 9. Business Process Workflows

Efficient business processes are the backbone of warehouse operations, ensuring smooth coordination between different activities and resources[30].

### 9.1 Storage Request Process

1. **Request Submission**:
   - Customer submits storage request with cargo details and timing requirements[30]
   - System validates request data and assigns a unique identifier[30]
   - Request status is set to "pending"[30]

2. **Request Evaluation**:
   - Logistics coordinator reviews request details[30]
   - System checks for available capacity in appropriate zones[30]
   - Coordinator approves or rejects the request based on availability and business rules[30]

3. **Reservation Creation**:
   - For approved requests, system creates storage reservations[30]
   - Specific shelves are allocated based on cargo requirements[30]
   - Reservation details are communicated to the customer[30]

4. **Dock Scheduling**:
   - System schedules dock appointment for cargo arrival[30]
   - Dock availability is checked and reserved[30]

5. **Cargo Receipt**:
   - Cargo arrives at scheduled dock appointment[30]
   - Warehouse staff verifies cargo against reservation details[30]
   - System creates storage record with actual entry date[30]

6. **Storage Placement**:
   - Cargo is moved to assigned storage location[30]
   - System updates inventory and capacity records[30]
   - Cargo event is recorded in the system[30]

7. **Billing Initiation**:
   - System calculates storage fees based on actual usage[30]
   - Invoice is generated and sent to the customer[30]
   - Payment status is tracked in the system[30]

### 9.2 Cargo Retrieval Process

1. **Retrieval Request**:
   - Customer or system initiates retrieval based on scheduled exit date[30]
   - System validates request and assigns retrieval task[30]

2. **Task Assignment**:
   - System assigns retrieval task to available warehouse staff[30]
   - Required equipment is allocated for the task[30]

3. **Cargo Retrieval**:
   - Staff locates and retrieves cargo from storage location[30]
   - System updates inventory and capacity records[30]
   - Cargo event is recorded in the system[30]

4. **Dock Scheduling**:
   - System schedules dock appointment for cargo departure[30]

"inventory" Should include these features:

Inventory Overview: Summary of current inventory levels and statuses
Stock Search: Advanced search functionality for finding specific items
Inventory Adjustments: Tools for correcting inventory discrepancies
Stock Transfers: Management of inventory movement between locations
Implement a dock management that would include a listing of the docks Specifying their status and availability. And if a dog is empty, then it's outlined. If it's occupied, then it says, like, occupied by what? It also tells some information about the reservations. But there is also a subpage for each doc details to see the availability and at what time is it going to be occupied and by what.
```

- follow-up:

```
Implement the reports tab so that it would include:

Operational metrics and KPIs for warehouse performance
Utilization reports for space, equipment, and personnel
Financial reports for billing and revenue tracking
Audit trails for regulatory compliance and security
Also, I need you to do a refactor. I want you to restructure the files and directories within the application. So inside the app directory, there should be directories that outline the tabs of the application. So there would be app/dashboard, app/dock-management (that would include both dock-management and dock-detail), app/inventory, app/auth, app/reports, app/storage-requests (that would include both storage-requests and storage-request-detail), app/warehouse-map, app/user-management. Move the components to their appropriate directories. Also move the services from src/app/services into appropriate new directories.

Separate dashboard stats from warehouse service into dashboard service.

Separate all mock object data into separate files. So that would be app/usermanagement/users.mock.ts - Move away from auth service. Similarly, please move away the warehouse mock data away from warehouse service into src/warehouse-map/warehouse.mock.ts. And so on and so forth.
```

```
I would like to have an icon somewhere near the WMS logo that would basically collapse the left-hand side navigation. You might need to refactor a little bit of HTML and CSS. Basically, whenever this icon is being clicked, I would like a nice animation that would basically gently hide the left-hand side navigation.

Also, near the John manager, the person that is logged in, there is an avatar with a single character and nearby on the left, there is an icon. I believe it was supposed to be an icon of a bell. So you could basically install a library of some, I don't know, maybe Lucid icons. You can try to replace the existing custom SVG icons with "npm install lucide-angular" (https://lucide.dev/guide/packages/lucide-angular).

I want you to rename the inventory tab into Cargo Management tab. For each cargo item there should be a details link that would lead to cargo details view. The details should include information such as, like main information such as description, weight, volume and entry date, as well as the current location. So basically the same information as you've got in the main view. And below, there would be three sub tabs, the event timeline, the location history and the documentation. Event timeline includes a basically visual timeline, vertically displaying what was the event that took place such as cargo received at a given dock, like inspection completed, all items in good condition, then moved to a different storage location by whom and when, etc. There would also be a location history, for instance, received at a dock and then moved to a specific piece of the specific section of the warehouse such as zone, aisle, rack and shelf. Finally, the documentation sub tab would basically include the documents that were relevant for this exact cargo.

There should also be a new tab called billing and payments that would deal with invoices, payments, financial reports, etc. Put a little bit of the stats at the top like total revenue, total invoices, paid invoices, overdue invoices, etc. And then put a sub-tabs similar to the cargo management view where we would have the invoice generation, payment processing, billing history, and financial reports. Invoice generation would include a list of invoices with actions such as view and edit and basic information such as the invoice number, the status like paid, sent, overdue, what is the company like issue date, due date, amount, paid and so on. There should also be a search by the name of the invoice or the status. The payment processing and billing history can be left unimplemented for now, so basically just generate the file but put a non-implemented yet. And the financial reports should include a financial report saying what is the revenue summary like total revenue, total invoices, paid invoices, overdue invoices, and performance metrics, average payment time, collection rate, average invoice value. There should also be some buttons such as export report and download PDF.
```

- follow-up:

```
1. The main icon + label "WMS" should be clickable And lead to the main page.

2. The storage request subpage needs a new service file that would be called "storage-requests-filters.service". It would include the filter for the status customer date from end date to. It would be implemented with simple angular native signals and computed.

3. Inside the navigation on the left hand side, whenever I walk into each of these tabs to a certain page or a sub page, one of these needs to be marked as active. For instance, when I walk into cargo management, the cargo management navigation line needs to be emphasized somehow. For instance, change the background color to darker, whatever. But if I go into a sub page of a cargo management, for instance, cargo details, it also, the cargo management on the left hand side still needs to remain active.

4. Please replace the icon that you've used for collapsing the left-hand side menu. When the menu is visible and I want to collapse it, please use the "square-chevron-left" lucide icon. And when the menu is collapsed, please replace it with the "square-chevron-right" lucide icon. That would look a lot better.

5. Please create a new tab called Reservations. Include a new icon that would fit in the navigation. Reservations should include data about the storage requests that have been accepted and now some warehouse space is being reserved at a specific zone, aisle, rack and shelf. Also, for a given company, for a given period of time and related to a given payment. So all of these information should be included in the listing for each item.

6.In the dashboard, at the top of the page, there are four statistics. Capacity, utilization, pending requests, monthly revenue and active reservations. They all should be clickable and lead to the following subpages:

- "Capacity Utilization" Should lead to the main "cargo management" link.
- "Pending requests." Should lead to the storage requests, but also set the Status Filter to Pending (inside storage-requests-filters.service).
- " Monthly revenue" Should link to the "billing and payments" link.
- " Active reservations" should link to the "reservations" tab.
```

- follow-up:

```
Let's work on the "billing and payments" subpage.
Inside the "invoice generation" tab We've got a listing of items and there are the view and edit actions. Let's drop the edit action and let's also create the view subpage That would display all the details of the invoice.

Create a new service billing-payments-filters.service for the " Billing and Payments" tab. Similar to the storage requests filters, it should be basically an angular service that includes native angular signals and a computer on top of that. That would basically manage the state of the filters.

The Reservations tab search should also include the warehouse itself. So there should be a search, then status filters, then warehouse, and then the existing zone and period. The warehouse should be taken from the warehouse mocks.
Each reservation row has a payment column. This should be clickable so that when it gets clicked, it's being moved to a certain payment details (from the billing and payments section).

Please create the "Customers" new tab inside the left-hand side navigation and the "Customers" sub page. This would include a simple listing for the customer rows (including Company name, contact person, and the phone contact). There would be also a customer details page, which would include: Name, address, phone contact, email contact, tax ID, maybe some additional tax information, maybe the country of origin, A contact person name, And potentially something more.

Inside the cargo management tab on the cargo listing, each row has a customer information, so this customer should be linked to a specific customer subpage (inside "customers" section). Same for cargo details. There is a part inside the cargo information about the customer. It should be linked to the customer details subpage. Similar in Reservations tab. Inside the listing, each row has a customer column and it should link to the customer's details subpage. And the same for billing and payment section inside the invoice generation tab. There is a customer column inside each row. And this should also be linked to the customer details subpage.
```

- follow-up:

```
Please reformat the template of the invoice details file so that you use the built-in angular currency pipe and don't just display the dollar character explicitly. Use the built-in currency pipe.
```

- follow-up:

```
Please rename the "users" tab into "employees". Implement a listing there and the details for a specific employee according to the following data structure:

User Profile Data Model

User ID: Unique identifier (integer or UUID)
Full Name: First and last name (string)
Email Address: Unique, validated (string)
Phone Number: Optional, validated (string)
Photo/Avatar: Optional, for visual identification (URL or binary)
Active Status: Boolean (active/inactive/soft deleted)
Hire Date: Date of hire (datetime)
Last Login: Timestamp of most recent login (datetime)
Assigned Warehouses: List of warehouse assignments with:
Warehouse ID and name
Assignment period (from/until)
Roles: List of roles with:
Role ID and name (e.g., warehouse_manager, logistics_coordinator)
Assignment date
There would be also a new tab called "Role Management" and implement the following features there.

Role Management View: Core Features

Role List: Display all defined roles (name, description, permissions, number of assigned users)

Role Details: For each role, show:

Name and description
List of permissions (CRUD, approve, assign, etc.)
List of users assigned to the role
Assign/Remove Users:

Add users to a role (search and select from employee list)
Remove users from a role (with confirmation)
Create/Edit/Delete Roles:

Create new roles (define name, description, permissions)
Edit existing roles (change name, description, permissions)
Delete roles (with safety checks if users are assigned)
Permission Matrix: Visual matrix/grid of roles vs. permissions for quick overview and editing

Audit Log: Track changes to role assignments (who assigned/removed, when)

Search/Filter: By role name, user, or permission

Bulk Actions: Assign/remove multiple users to/from a role at once
User Profile Data Model

User ID: Unique identifier (integer or UUID)

Full Name: First and last name (string)

Email Address: Unique, validated (string)

Phone Number: Optional, validated (string)

Photo/Avatar: Optional, for visual identification (URL or binary)

Active Status: Boolean (active/inactive/soft deleted)

Hire Date: Date of hire (datetime)

Last Login: Timestamp of most recent login (datetime)

Assigned Warehouses: List of warehouse assignments with:

Warehouse ID and name
Assignment period (from/until)
Roles: List of roles with:

Role ID and name (e.g., warehouse_manager, logistics_coordinator)
Assignment date
Finally, the settings tab should be basically the basic settings for the user, which include the email, the name and some other basic information.
```

- follow-up:

```
Please split the cargo-details component into following new components. The cargo-details-information, Cargo-Event-Timeline, Cargo-Location-History, Cargo-Documentation.

Also, please, click the Cargo Management component into Cargo Management Stats, Cargo Listing and Cargo Listing Filters.

Basically you're supposed to break two very big components into smaller components. I want you to use the new Angular signal-based input functions instead of the @Input decorators.

Also, please implement the Cargo Listing Filter Service, which is going to implement a simple Angular service, including Angular native signals and computed. That would handle the search items, and that is the search name, the category, the status, and the zone. Basically, all the four filters used in the Cargo Management component.
```

- follow-up:

```
Please refactor the components inside the customer's directory. Use Angular signal-based input functions instead of the @input decorators.

First, break the customer details component into customer details actions and customer details cards.

Then break the customers listing component into three smaller components. And these are the customer listing, the customer listing filters and customers stats.

Also, create the customer listing filter service, which is going to be very similar to other services inside this repo, which would be a simple Angular service using Angular native signals and computates. And this service is going to handle the search customers and the statuses, so basically the two searching widgets inside the customer listing page.
```

- follow-up:

```
Please split the Reservations component into smaller components, and that would be the Reservations stats, the Reservations listing, filters, and Reservations listing.

Create the appropriate components in the new files nearby.
```

- follow-up:

```
Extract smaller components from role management component. So each of the four tabs should be extracted as a smaller subcomponent. The role management tab, audit log component. Another role management tab, permission matrix component. Another role management tab, roles list component. And the last one, role management tab, user assignment component.
```

- follow-up:

```
add a new navigation link (put it under "cargo management" navigation link) and implement subpage called "Warehouse Operations" Which should include 3 tabs (each as a separate component):
- Zone Management: Configuration and monitoring of warehouse zones
- Dock Scheduling: Calendar interface for managing dock appointments
- Task Assignment: Allocation of tasks to warehouse personnel

Also, please create a box or a tooltip, I'm not sure how to do it, for the notifications. So after the login, the user has an avatar just at the top of the page and there is an alarm icon with red circle. I hope the circle can include a number of notifications and when the alert is clicked, then the notifications are being shown. That should be just a standard intuitive alert box.

Finally, I need a notification, maybe that's called broker notification, I'm not sure. However, when there is an action being performed by the system, there should be a visual small sliding box, usually at the bottom of the page, showing some label, some type of a warning information error, etc. and it basically hides after 5 seconds or so. So, you know, just a very nice and slick animation.

I want you to add this animation inside the customers tab. So for each customer there should be a deactivate action. After the deactivate action is clicked, then this information notification pops up.

Finally, implement the form inside the customers section and there is an add customer button. So when the button is clicked, then there should be a pop-up opening and there should be a form for adding a customer with all the customer related information. There should be a cancel and submit button. After the submit button is being clicked, then a proper notification should also be shown. And of course, the pop-up should be closed.
```

- follow-up:

```
Please split the dock management component into dock listing component and dock stats component.

Also, there is a Schedule Appointment button inside the Dock Management subpage. I want you to implement the whole form inside the Dock Form Schedule Appointment component. Now it should include all of the information about the new appointment. When the information is passed, there will be a Submit button, a Cancel button. When it's submitted correctly, then there is a notification being sent. notification to the notification service obviously.
```

- follow-up:

```
Implement the storage request details component as it's missing right now.

Split the storage requests component into storage requests listing filters component and storage requests listing component. Moreover, provide a storage request  listingfilters service, which is going to be a similar angular service to the other ones inside the application that would create native angular signals and the computed that would be used to fuel the four filters inside storage request status, customer, the date from and the ending date to.

There should be also a new component, a storage request, form, new request. That would accept All the data required to create a new request and there would be a submit button, a console button similar as other forms inside the project. And when the submit is successfully being called, then there is a notification sent to the notification service. If there is some error from the backend, then there will be an error notification and the pop-up is being displayed and closed depending on whether the form is opened.
```

Please implement the new reservation form, a similar one that would look like a pop-up as other forms in the project. So that's where you walk into the reservations subpage and there is a new reservation button. So again, put all the details that might be necessary for a new reservation. There would be a submit and cancel button, same after submission, there would, a successful submission, there would be a information notification or an error notification that is being sent via the notification service.

# merging D3 visualization (warehouse d3 visualization) into Angular codebase

Wizualizacja warehouse w d3 została zrobiona w lovable, które umiało tylko w reacta. Dlatego komponent, który "embedował" wizualizację, reactowy, musiał zostać skonwertowany/dostosowany do Angulara.

- poniższy prompt wykonał migrację
- kontekst (prompta) zawierał angularowy `warehouse-map.component.ts`, ale dodatkowo wkleiłem obok (w tym samym folderze) 4 pliki z implementacji z lovable (3 x czysty TS = 1 x react)
- model: Claude Sonnet 4 MAX (cursor)

```
@warehouse-map.component.ts There is a section visualization inside the warehouse-map component. Now we need to fill it with a warehouse visualization that comes from another file.@warehouse-visualization.ts The trick is that this visualization comes from a React project and was used directly inside the warehouse-dashboard.com.@WarehouseDashboard.tsx  We don't want to use this warehouse dashboard. You can just treat it as a point of reference how the refs were used. Now we would probably need some, I don't know, view child, view children. I don't know, basically some idiomatic Angular solution. So warehouse-visualization file includes standalone JavaScript functions that can be used with any framework. And they should be used most probably inside ngoninit, Angular component, I don't know. Here are two other very important files, the warehouse types, which includes the various types for definitions of what's going on inside the warehouse, and the warehouse-structure-generator, which generates randomized content for the warehouse. like you know, what are the racks, what are the aisles, what are the zones, etc.@warehouse-structure-generator.ts @warehouse.types.ts Your task is to correctly use and embed the warehouse visualization inside the visualization section of the Angular warehouse map component. You can take the React implementation only as a point of reference because I am going to remove it later. Now, do your best to make the visualization work inside Angular.
```
