I am developing a modern logistics warehouse management application that emphasizes clarity, interactivity, and scalability. The primary goal is to provide an intuitive, visually engaging warehouse map that allows users to easily analyze, manage, and optimize the arrangement and utilization of racks, aisles, and docks. The application will feature a clean, grid-based design with interactive elements such as color-coded zones, tooltips, and dynamic tile sizing to make complex logistics data accessible at a glance. The solution is built in Angular for the application shell, but the visualization engine itself is implemented in a fully framework-agnostic way using D3.js and TypeScript. This approach ensures that the visualization can be reused in other web frameworks such as React or Vue. The style and functionality are intended to support real-world logistics workflows, enabling both static and dynamically generated warehouse layouts, with a strong focus on maintainability and extensibility.

---

## **D3 Visualization Requirements**

- **Warehouse Grid Layout**:  
  The visualization should depict the warehouse as a 30-column by 12-row grid, providing a large and detailed view of the space. To accommodate the extensive width, horizontal scrolling must be implemented, allowing users to navigate the full breadth of the warehouse. Each grid cell represents a specific warehouse elementâ€”rack, aisle, or dockâ€”based on the provided data.

- **Tile Types and Characteristics**:  
  - **Aisle Tiles**:  
    Aisles are displayed as gray tiles. Their size should adapt based on their arrangement: if an entire row consists of aisles, those tiles should be rendered at half the standard height; if an entire column consists of aisles, those tiles should be half the standard width. This visual differentiation helps users quickly identify pathways and improves spatial clarity. Aisles are always positioned to ensure that all racks are accessible from at least one side.
  - **Rack Tiles**:  
    Racks are represented as colored squares, with their color determined by their assigned zone. To maintain accessibility, no rack zone should form a block larger than 2 tiles in either width or height, ensuring aisles are always adjacent for access. When hovered, racks display a tooltip with detailed capacity information, including total capacity, used space, and available space.
  - **Dock Tiles**:  
    The top row of the grid is reserved exclusively for docks, providing a logical placement for loading and unloading activities. Docks use distinct color coding: a lighter color indicates an available dock, while a darker shade (along with a truck icon) indicates an occupied dock. If a dock is occupied, hovering over the truck icon reveals a tooltip with information about the truck and its cargo.

- **Color Configuration and Zone Representation**:  
  All color assignments for zones and dock states are defined in a JavaScript object exported from the D3 implementation file. Each zone (such as storage, assembly, shipping, receiving, processing, etc.) is mapped to a unique color, making it easy to visually distinguish different functional areas. Docks have separate color definitions for available and occupied states.

- **Interactivity and Tooltip Behavior**:  
  - When a user hovers over any tile (rack, dock, or aisle), a tooltip appears, displaying relevant information (e.g., rack capacity, dock status, truck details).
  - If a tile is clicked, the tooltip remains visible even after the mouse moves away, allowing users to examine the information in detail. The tooltip can be closed either by clicking the tile again, clicking a close button, or clicking another tile (which opens its tooltip instead).
  - The visualization supports zoom in and zoom out functionality, allowing users to focus on specific areas or view the warehouse as a whole.

- **Legend and Highlighting Integration**:  
  The Angular application should include a comprehensive legend that visually explains the color coding for all zones, aisles, and dock states (available and occupied). The legend should list all functional zone types and their associated colors. When a user hovers over or clicks a legend item, the corresponding tiles in the D3 visualization should be highlightedâ€”displayed at normal brightnessâ€”while all other tiles are dimmed. This helps users quickly locate and focus on specific areas or features. This interaction requires the D3 visualization to listen for and respond to JavaScript events triggered by the Angular framework.

- **Layout and Tile Arrangement Rules**:  
  - The grid should be tightly packed, with no visible gaps between tiles, even when aisle tiles are rendered at reduced size.
  - Rack zones must never exceed 2 tiles in width or height, ensuring optimal accessibility.
  - Docks are strictly limited to the top row, reinforcing their role in warehouse logistics.

---

## **Framework-Agnostic D3 Implementation**

- **TypeScript Visualization Module**:  
  The D3 visualization logic is encapsulated in a standalone TypeScript file that does not depend on Angular or any other framework. This module exports a main function, such as `renderWarehouse`, which accepts a DOM element reference and a data object describing the warehouse layout. The visualization logic should be fully reusable in any web framework, including React or Vue, by simply passing a reference to the container element.

  ```typescript
  export function renderWarehouse(element: HTMLElement, data: WarehouseData): void {
    // D3 visualization code goes here
  }

  export const TileTypes = {
    AISLE: 'aisle',
    RACK: 'rack',
    DOCK: 'dock'
  };

  export const Colors = {
    zones: { /* zone-color mapping, e.g., storage, assembly, shipping, etc. */ },
    docks: { available: "#A3D977", occupied: "#5A8E3E" }
  };
  ```

- **Parameterization and Data-Driven Design**:  
  The main function should accept:
  - A DOM element reference where the SVG visualization will be rendered.
  - A data object (usually parsed from JSON) that defines the grid layout, tile types, zone assignments, and additional properties such as rack capacities and dock statuses.

- **Legend Highlighting and Event Handling**:  
  The D3 module must provide a mechanism (such as custom JavaScript events or a public API) to allow the Angular framework to trigger highlight actions. When a legend item is hovered or clicked, Angular should be able to instruct the D3 visualization to highlight all matching tiles and dim others, making it easy to visually filter the warehouse by zone or tile type.

- **Tile and Color Definitions**:  
  The D3 module should export explicit objects for tile types and color mappings, so that both the visualization and the Angular legend remain consistent and synchronized.

---

## **Angular Application Integration**

- **Component Embedding**:  
  In Angular, the D3 visualization should be embedded in a component by referencing a container element (e.g., using `@ViewChild`). After the componentâ€™s view initializes, the D3 rendering function is called with the container reference and the warehouse data.

  ```typescript
  @ViewChild('visualizationContainer') container!: ElementRef;

  ngAfterViewInit() {
    renderWarehouse(this.container.nativeElement, warehouseData);
  }
  ```

- **User Interface Structure**:  
  The application should include a header, side menu, footer, and tabs as part of its overall layout. These elements can be implemented as placeholders, with the main focus on the warehouse visualization, which should be positioned directly below the header. The visualization area should support horizontal scrolling to accommodate the full 30Ã—12 grid.

- **Legend Implementation and Interaction**:  
  The Angular application must provide a legend that displays all zone types, aisle, and dock states, each with their corresponding color. The legend should be interactive: hovering or clicking on a legend item should trigger a highlighting event in the D3 visualization, visually emphasizing the relevant tiles and dimming the rest.

---

## **Data Structure and Generation**

- **Warehouse Data Model**:  
  The data structure should represent the entire grid, with each tile defined by its type (rack, aisle, or dock), zone assignment (for racks), capacity details (for racks), and status (for docks, including truck and cargo info if occupied). Zones should be defined with unique IDs and color assignments.

  ```json
  {
    "grid": [
      {"type": "dock", "status": "occupied", "truck": { "cargo": "Electronics" }},
      {"type": "rack", "zone": "A", "capacity": {"total": 100, "used": 40}},
      {"type": "aisle", "isFullRow": true}
    ],
    "zones": {
      "A": { "color": "#FF5733", "accessPaths": ["N", "S"] }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Dynamic and Static Layout Support**:  
  The D3 module should optionally export a function that can generate a warehouse layout dynamically based on configuration options (such as grid size, number of zones, aisle placement rules, etc.), as well as support static layouts defined directly in JSON.

---

## **Key Constraints and Best Practices**

- Rack zones must never be larger than 2 tiles in either width or height, ensuring every rack is accessible from an aisle.
- All aisles must be positioned to border rack zones, guaranteeing access throughout the warehouse.
- Docks are strictly limited to the top row of the grid.
- The visualization is entirely data-driven, supporting both static definitions and dynamic generation.
- All interactivityâ€”including tooltips, persistent tooltips on click, and highlighting via legendâ€”must be accessible via framework-agnostic JavaScript events, ensuring seamless integration and extensibility.
- The design should prioritize clarity, usability, and maintainability, making it suitable for real-world logistics operations and future enhancements.

This detailed specification provides a robust, extensible foundation for developing an interactive warehouse management visualization system, balancing advanced interactivity with a clean, maintainable architecture.

1. I would like the legend not to be on the side, but to be just below the visualization itself. However, I want you to leave the side panel, for instance, for some kind of menu or general application navigation.

2. There needs to be a single source of truth for the definition of the warehouse space, of the availability of the racks, of the zones, of the aisles, etc. This should be provided in a separate TypeScript file along with TypeScript types. When Angular is running the visualization, it would basically reach out to this data and pass it to the visualizer. 

3. The visualization legend would be using the unified data, the single source of truth data, so that when I hover a zone in the legend, the number of racks is always correct. Currently, when I hover a zone in the legend, the number of racks seems to be totally random and dynamic, so you need to fix this significantly. 

4. The warehouse Data Generator needs an update. Right now, the only stable thing is the row for the docks, which is okay. There are also rows for the aisles, and they are also okay. However, the rows for the racks are very bad - They are totally random and they don't outline how warehouses are organized. See following example (the `X`s are the racks, the `-`s are the aisles):
```
----------------
-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-
-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-
----------------
```
This is not random and each section would be a separate zone and each rack could be easily accessible. Now, all zones don't need to be of the same length, obviously, but they cannot be random as they are right now.

5. The warehouse data generator should also include some more rules for aisles: Aisles can be either long horizontally or long vertically, just for simplicity. Each horizontal isle should have its separate name. Each vertical aisle should also have its separate name. These should be also outlined in the legend so that it's not just "aisles", but specific horizontal or vertical aisles. And when a horizontal or vertical aisle gets hovered in the legend, then appropriate tiles get highlighted. Obviously the aisles on the crossings could fall into multiple aisles, like horizontal and vertical at the same time, obviously. All I/O should have specific naming. Like, you know, H1 for horizontal, H2 for horizontal, vertical, 1 vertical, 2 V1, V2, etc. And there should also be a dock I/O for where the docking space is.

6. There is a tiny issue with a tile that has an occupied dock. So when I hover over the truck icon itself, I lose the tooltip. If I hover over the tile, but not the truck itself, I see the tooltip. So what I want to have is that no matter whether I hover the truck icon or the remaining of the tile, I want to see the tooltip anyway.

7. There is an issue with sticky tooltips. So I can click the tooltip and I can see that it's clicked and this works perfectly fine. However, if I move away, then different tooltips of different tiles get shown and this is not what I want. I think there should be a variable that defines what is the mode of the visualizer so that it's either sticky to a separate tile or not, so that, depending on the state of this variable, either the tooltip is being sticked to a specific tile or basically it's not sticked, not sticky, it would basically outline whatever tile is just being hovered.

8. I want the rack tile colors to be less pastel and more like stronger. Currently, they are too delicate.

9. Also, the distinction for some of the tiles to be 50% of the original height or width, only for aisles, is troublesome technically. So let's simplify that. No matter whether something is an aisle or a different type of tile, all should have the very same size.

# zajÄ™toÅ›Ä‡ warehouse visualization (lovable)

- follow-up prompt:

```
I would need you to significantly make the zone legend component smaller in a way that each of the zone elements would not be a separate tile, but would be rather a small piece of the color and basically a label zone A. They would be inlined. So they would look similar as a legend is displayed on a graph. And it would be moved into the warehouse layout, just where the bullet point is with the three points like the hover over tiles for detailed information, etc. So remove those three bullet points and put the zone legend there and make it way smaller. Also, I don't need any information about the racks or the horizontal aisle or the ready-for-loading truck presented etc. So these additional descriptions are unnecessary, they just take too much space.

Also, I'm missing a zoom in, zoom out inside the warehouse layout. So I would need the buttons zoom in, zoom out inside the warehouse visualization. So it should not be react based. It should be somewhere within the D3 visualization. Also, it should be possible to move across this visualization, using dragging to the site horizontally, vertically, etc.

Finally, I would like you to improve the visual representation of each rack tile. So currently the rack is basically a square of the size 40. This stays, this is okay. However, each rack has a utilization, like in 27 out of 117 units, which gives 23%, whatever. But what I would like you to do is to visually highlight the utilization percent in a couple of ways. So the first way that I would like you to do that for the zone one, and that would be probably zone A. So that would be showing the availability of the rack. Now, if the availability goes below 10%, then it also should be displayed as an alert. The second way to show the availability, that would be for the second zone, zone B. This should be splitting the square into two rectangles that would outline somehow a progress. So let's say that for 23%, then the first 77% on the left hand side of the tile, which means 40 pixels. So 77% of 40 pixels, that would be probably something around 31 pixels. That would be one color and the remaining 23%. So that would be more or less nine pixels. That would be a slightly different color. So let's say if the zone itself is green, then the left or the right should be light green or dark green. And yeah, the animation is calculated for each tile separately. Finally, the last way to display the visual utilization of the rack should be to provide smaller squares. So the 40 pixels square tile should be split into, let's say, nine smaller squares, like 3 times 3 or 16 smaller squares, four times 4, whichever you pick. And then you would proportionally display these squares as either lighter or darker version of the original zone color. So for utilization, 23%, that would be two out of nine squares or four out of 16 squares. And that would be for the third zone, zone C. So I want you to implement three different ways to visualize the utilization and do that only for the first three zones. Strategy one, for zone one, strategy two, for zone two and strategy three for zone three, so that I can see all of them at the same time and compare them.
